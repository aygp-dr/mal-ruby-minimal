# Experiment 001: Ruby AST Validation

## Goal
Validate that the MAL implementation uses only the 13 essential Ruby AST nodes and no forbidden constructs (arrays, hashes, blocks).

## Method
1. Parse the Ruby source with Ripper
2. Count AST node usage
3. Verify no array literals, hash literals, or blocks
4. Compare to Ruby Essence findings

## Results

### Forbidden Constructs Check
- ✓ No array literals `[]` (except in comments)
- ✓ No hash literals `{}` (except in heredocs)
- ✓ No blocks with `do...end` or `{...}`
- ✓ Only uses cons cells for data structures

### Statistics
- Method definitions: 46
- Total lines: 481
- Non-blank lines: 426

### Key Implementation Patterns
1. **Cons cells** - All data structures built from pairs
2. **Object.new** - Custom types without classes
3. **Eval with heredocs** - Method injection without blocks
4. **While loops** - Iteration without each/map
5. **Recursive functions** - List processing

## Validation Scripts
- `analyze_ast.rb` - AST node counting
- `analyze_ast_v2.rb` - Direct source analysis
- `ruby_essence_comparison.rb` - Maps to 13 essential nodes

## Conclusion
The implementation successfully avoids Ruby's built-in data structures while still using most of the 13 essential AST nodes identified by Ruby Essence. This demonstrates that complex programs can be built with minimal language features.
