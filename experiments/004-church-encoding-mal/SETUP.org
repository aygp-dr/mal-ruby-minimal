* Church Encoding in MAL Lisp

This implementation provides Church encodings for MAL (Make-A-Lisp), demonstrating how to represent data structures using only functions. This is particularly relevant for understanding the theoretical foundations of Lisp and lambda calculus.

** Integration with MAL

*** Integration Guide

To integrate Church encodings into your MAL implementation:

#+begin_src lisp :tangle experiments/mal_church_integration.mal :mkdirp t
;; MAL Integration for Church Encoding
;; Load this after the main church_encoding.mal

;; Add Church encoding functions to the MAL core namespace
(def! add-church-to-core (fn* [core-ns]
  (doseq [entry church-encoding-exports]
    (let* [name (first entry)
           func (nth entry 1)]
      (env-set core-ns name func)))))

;; Example: Adding Church numerals to MAL's type system
(def! church-numeral? (fn* [obj]
  (try*
    (do
      ;; A Church numeral should be a function that takes 2 args
      (let* [test-result (obj (fn* [x] (+ x 1)) 0)]
        (number? test-result))
      true)
    (catch* _ false))))

;; Pretty printer for Church encodings
(def! pr-church (fn* [obj]
  (cond
    (church-numeral? obj)
      (str "#<church-numeral:" (church-num->int obj) ">")
    
    ;; Check if it's a Church boolean
    (try*
      (do
        (let* [as-bool (obj true false)]
          (if (or (= as-bool true) (= as-bool false))
            (str "#<church-bool:" as-bool ">")
            (str obj))))
      (catch* _ (str obj)))
    
    :else (str obj))))

;; Macro for Church encoding literals
(defmacro! church-lit (fn* [type val]
  (cond
    (= type :num) `(int->church-num ~val)
    (= type :bool) `(bool->church-bool ~val)
    (= type :list) `(list->church-list ~val)
    :else (throw "Unknown Church literal type"))))

;; Usage examples:
;; (def! five (church-lit :num 5))
;; (def! truth (church-lit :bool true))
;; (def! nums (church-lit :list '(1 2 3)))

*** Key Insights

1. **Everything is a Function**: In Church encoding, all data types are represented as functions
2. **Closure Property**: Church encodings rely on lexical closure to maintain state
3. **Lazy Evaluation**: Many Church operations benefit from lazy evaluation
4. **Self-Application**: The Y combinator enables recursion through self-application

** Performance Considerations

Church encodings are primarily of theoretical interest. For production use:

- Church numerals have O(n) complexity for most operations
- Native implementations are significantly faster
- Use Church encodings for:
  - Educational purposes
  - Theoretical proofs
  - Bootstrapping minimal systems
  - Understanding lambda calculus
