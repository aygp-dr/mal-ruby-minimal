WHY: Students need structured exercises and awareness of common mistakes to learn effectively.

CONTEXT: Pass 3 of pedagogical review. Based on teaching experience, students learn best with:
1. Progressive exercises that build on each other
2. Awareness of common mistakes before they make them
3. Concrete debugging strategies

CHANGES:
- Created 7-level exercise progression from basics to research projects
- Documented 10 most common pitfalls with explanations
- Added debugging tips and visual debugging strategies
- Included assessment rubric and solution hints

TESTING:
- Exercises tested for clarity and progression
- Pitfall examples verified against actual implementation
- Solution hints checked for correctness

IMPACT: Students have a clear learning path with:
- Self-paced exercises at appropriate difficulty
- Preemptive guidance on common mistakes
- Practical debugging techniques

FUTURE: Consider adding automated exercise checking or online judge system.
