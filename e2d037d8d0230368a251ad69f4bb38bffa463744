PRESENTATION CORRECTION COMPLETION

WHY: Correct misleading claims about Ruby Essence hypothesis
WHAT: Updated presentation with accurate empirical findings
HOW: Reframed narrative around constraint-driven design success

CORRECTIONS MADE:
- Ruby Essence hypothesis NOT validated (88+ node types found)
- Educational constraint approach VALIDATED (complete interpreter achieved)
- Technical accuracy restored while maintaining pedagogical value
- Data tables updated with correct empirical findings

NARRATIVE REFRAME:
- Original claim: 'Ruby Essence 13-node hypothesis confirmed'
- Corrected claim: 'Minimal subset constraint-driven design effective'
- Educational value preserved: extreme constraints drive deep learning
- Technical honesty: production Ruby requires comprehensive AST support

This correction maintains the presentation's educational message while ensuring technical accuracy. The constraint-driven approach remains pedagogically powerful even though it doesn't represent production Ruby complexity.
