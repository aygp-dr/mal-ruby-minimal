WHY: Pass 5 provides final polish and creates a complete educational
package with assessment tools and reflections on the journey.

CONTEXT: This is the final pedagogical review pass as requested by the user.
After 5 passes, we've transformed a minimal implementation into a
comprehensive teaching tool.

IMPLEMENTATION:
- Documentation index for easy navigation
- Assessment rubric for educators
- Project reflection capturing lessons learned
- Main README updated with journey summary

PEDAGOGICAL VALUE:
- Complete learning package
- Clear assessment criteria
- Honest reflection on trade-offs
- Inspiration for future work

WHAT WE ACHIEVED:
1. Working Lisp interpreter with extreme constraints
2. 10+ comprehensive documentation files
3. 100+ tests ensuring correctness
4. Visual aids and diagrams
5. Complete educational framework

LESSONS LEARNED:
- Constraints force deep understanding
- Simple isn't easy but teaches better
- Documentation is as important as code
- Multiple perspectives help different learners
- Joy and beauty matter in education

NEXT STEPS:
- Fix remaining quasiquote issues
- Implement steps 8-A (macros, try, self-hosting)
- Create interactive tutorials
- Build community around teaching with constraints
