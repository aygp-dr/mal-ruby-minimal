WHY: Need consistent documentation for all commits to make the project reproducible and educational.

CONTEXT: When teaching or revisiting this project, we need to understand not just WHAT changed but WHY it changed and HOW to verify it works. This is especially important for a pedagogical project.

CHANGES:
- Created comprehensive git notes template
- Added examples for different types of commits (features, bugs, docs)
- Included git commands for managing notes
- Structured format: WHY, CONTEXT, CHANGES, TESTING, IMPACT, FUTURE

TESTING:
- Template is markdown, viewable in any editor
- Examples demonstrate real commits from this project
- Git commands tested and verified to work

IMPACT: Future contributors (including ourselves) will have clear guidelines for documenting changes. Makes the project more maintainable and educational.

FUTURE: Apply this template to all significant commits going forward. Consider adding git hooks to remind about notes.
