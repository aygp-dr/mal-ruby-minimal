Fixed org-babel tangling for experiments 005 and 006.

Technical details:
- SETUP.org files use literate programming to combine documentation and code
- org-babel-tangle extracts code blocks to files specified by :tangle headers
- Previous paths used subdirectories (sicp/) that didn't match actual structure
- Now uses relative paths (./) to create files in experiment directories
- Makefile targets run emacs in batch mode to perform tangling
- This enables regenerating all MAL files from the org documentation

The tangling process works by:
1. emacs loads the SETUP.org file
2. org-babel-tangle-file extracts all code blocks
3. Files are created according to :tangle headers
4. Makefile provides convenient gmake tangle interface
