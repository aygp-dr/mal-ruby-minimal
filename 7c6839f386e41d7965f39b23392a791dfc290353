Created comprehensive MAL examples demonstrating advanced capabilities:

1. algorithms.mal:
   - Sorting: bubble sort, quicksort, merge sort
   - Searching: linear and binary search
   - Math: GCD, LCM, prime checking, sieve of Eratosthenes
   - String: palindrome checking
   - All implemented using only cons cells and recursion

2. data-structures.mal:
   - Stack and Queue using atoms for mutation
   - Binary Search Tree with insert/search/traversal
   - Association lists as key-value stores
   - Graph representation with DFS traversal
   - Shows how complex structures emerge from simple pairs

3. functional-patterns.mal:
   - Function composition and pipelines
   - Partial application and currying
   - Maybe and Either monads for error handling
   - Lazy evaluation with thunks
   - Memoization for performance
   - Transducers for composable transformations
   - Y combinator for anonymous recursion

Also fixed mal-mode.el:
- Updated tangle paths to avoid overwriting other files
- Successfully tangled and tested with emacs
- Provides syntax highlighting, indentation, paredit support
- REPL integration for interactive development

These examples prove that extreme constraints (no arrays/hashes/blocks)
don't limit expressiveness - they force elegant solutions.
