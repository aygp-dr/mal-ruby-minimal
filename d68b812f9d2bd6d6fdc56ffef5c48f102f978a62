WHY: The previous linear diagram looked like a simple ordered list and didn't convey the architectural relationships between components.

CONTEXT: For pedagogical purposes, we need to show:
1. How the REPL components interact (sequence diagram)
2. The logical grouping of implementation steps (foundation, features, advanced)
3. The flow of data through the system

CHANGES:
- Added sequence diagram showing a complete REPL cycle for '(+ 1 2)'
- Grouped steps into three phases: Core Foundation, Language Features, Advanced
- Shows the actual interaction between Reader, Evaluator, Printer, and Environment

TESTING:
- Visual inspection in GitHub/GitLab markdown renderer
- Mermaid diagram validation at mermaid.live
- Ensures educational clarity for students

IMPACT: Students can now see both the high-level architecture and the implementation progression, making it easier to understand how the pieces fit together.
