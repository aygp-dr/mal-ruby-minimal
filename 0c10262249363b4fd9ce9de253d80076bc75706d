Parse Tree Analysis Phase 1 Complete

WHY: Continue incremental exploration of Ruby parse trees as requested by user

APPROACH:
- Systematic analysis starting with MAL progression
- Compare structural patterns across different domains
- Document complexity growth from minimal to complex implementations

KEY DISCOVERIES:
1. Step2 shows 5x complexity jump when evaluation logic is introduced
2. ActiveAdmin shows module/class/DSL patterns vs MAL's functional approach
3. Liquid template engine has heavy attribute declaration patterns
4. Different domains create fundamentally different AST structures

TECHNICAL INSIGHTS:
- NODE_SCOPE/NODE_BLOCK are universal structural elements
- NODE_DEFN patterns vary significantly (functions vs methods vs DSL)
- Domain-specific node types emerge (NODE_MODULE for frameworks, NODE_ITER for loops)
- Parse tree size correlates with algorithmic complexity, not just LOC

NEXT: Continue with Liquid analysis and stepA self-hosting complexity
