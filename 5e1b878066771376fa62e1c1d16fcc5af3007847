Created Ruby LSP validation experiment (013) with comprehensive LSP protocol testing framework. Includes Pydantic models for LSP JSON structures, lifecycle diagrams, and plans for deep analysis via submodules. This experiment will help validate and improve development tooling for MAL and similar dynamic language projects.
