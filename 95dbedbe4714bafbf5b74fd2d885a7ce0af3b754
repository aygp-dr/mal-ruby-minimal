Banner alignment debugging revealed important workflow lessons:

1. Directory navigation issues:
   - Using cd and .. in bash commands breaks reproducibility
   - Context gets lost, especially after shell resets
   - Solution: Always use gmake -C from project root

2. Text formatting challenges:
   - Editors/systems auto-trim trailing spaces
   - Line length calculations affected by Unicode characters
   - Different tools (sed/gsed, awk/gawk) have syntax variations
   - Escape sequences in gawk need careful handling

3. Debugging approach:
   - Created comprehensive debugging tools in experiment 009
   - Used gawk to analyze line lengths programmatically
   - Attempted multiple automated fixes with gsed
   - Ultimately required manual intervention

4. Best practices established:
   - Work from project root with explicit paths
   - Use gmake -C for entering directories in commands
   - Create validation targets for formatting checks
   - Document failed attempts for learning value

The experiment demonstrates that some problems (like fighting auto-formatting)
are better solved with manual intervention than complex automation.
