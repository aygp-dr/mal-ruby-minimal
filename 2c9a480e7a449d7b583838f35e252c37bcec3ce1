WHY: Students benefit from immediate visual feedback about what makes this
implementation special. The banner explains constraints upfront.

CONTEXT: During pedagogical review pass 4, realized students need clear
visual indicators of the implementation's unique characteristics.

IMPLEMENTATION:
- ASCII art banner in resources/banner.txt
- Conditional loading in mal_minimal.rb
- Screenshot showing actual REPL interaction with factorial

TESTING:
- Manually tested with make tmux-repl
- Captured actual session output
- Verified banner displays correctly

PEDAGOGICAL VALUE:
- Immediate visual impact
- Clear statement of constraints
- Working example in the banner
- Real REPL session in README

INTEGRATION:
- Falls back gracefully if banner missing
- Doesn't break existing tests
- New tmux-repl target for demos
