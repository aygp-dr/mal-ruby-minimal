COMPREHENSIVE AST ANALYSIS COMPLETION

This commit represents a major empirical validation effort that refutes our original Ruby Essence hypothesis.

WHY: Validate the 13-node Ruby Essence hypothesis against real-world codebases
WHAT: Comprehensive analysis of 412 Ruby files across 10 major projects
HOW: Ruby's built-in --dump=parsetree + brute force analysis

KEY FINDINGS:
- Ruby Essence hypothesis is INSUFFICIENT (only 11.4% coverage)
- Real Ruby requires 88 unique AST node types
- 78 additional nodes needed beyond proposed 13
- Practical minimum: 39 nodes for 85% coverage

METHODOLOGY:
- Analyzed Rails, ActiveAdmin, Shopify, Puma, Sidekiq, RuboCop, etc.
- Generated 101 parse tree dumps for manual inspection
- Frequency analysis reveals scope/block/list dominate usage
- Missing critical nodes: send, int, def (naming inconsistencies)

IMPLICATIONS:
- Educational constraint (13 nodes) \!= Production reality (88 nodes)
- Our MAL implementation validates constraint-driven learning
- Architecture guild presentation needs major revision
- Self-hosting analysis now has empirical foundation

This represents the most comprehensive Ruby AST analysis in the project and fundamentally changes our understanding of Ruby's essential complexity.
