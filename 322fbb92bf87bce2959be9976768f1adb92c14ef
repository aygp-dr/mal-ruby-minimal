Added complete experiment infrastructure and content:

Experiment 005 (SICP):
- Created SETUP.org with literate programming structure
- Generated 18 MAL files covering all 4 SICP chapters
- Fixed tangle paths to use relative paths (./ instead of sicp/)
- Includes examples from basic procedures to metacircular evaluator
- Each chapter file contains working examples with MAL syntax

Experiment 006 (Let Over Lambda):
- Created comprehensive SETUP.org file
- Generated 8 advanced Lisp pattern files
- Covers closures, macros, anaphoric constructs, pandoric patterns
- Includes DSL creation and runtime code modification
- Performance optimization and memory management patterns

Experiment 008 (Emacs Integration):
- Created test suite to validate mal-ruby-minimal.el
- Tests major mode association, key bindings, REPL integration
- Specific tests for paredit functionality with MAL syntax
- Validates syntax highlighting and project navigation
- Results show most features working correctly

Technical details:
- org-babel-tangle extracts code from :tangle headers
- Makefiles include 'gmake tangle' targets
- All files use proper MAL syntax (def\!, fn*, let*)
- Files are executable with proper shebang handling
