WHY: Students need detailed explanations to understand the non-obvious aspects of the implementation.

CONTEXT: Pass 3 of pedagogical review focuses on inline documentation and visual explanations. Many concepts (cons cells, environments, evaluation) are abstract and benefit from visualization.

CHANGES:
- Created reader_commented.rb with extensive inline documentation
- Created env_commented.rb explaining lexical scoping and environments
- Added evaluation-walkthrough.md tracing through concrete examples
- Added cons-cell-visualizations.md with ASCII art diagrams

TESTING:
- Documentation is in markdown/ruby comments
- ASCII art tested for alignment
- Code examples verified against implementation

IMPACT: Students can now:
- See visual representations of abstract concepts
- Trace through evaluation step by step
- Understand the 'why' behind implementation choices
- Work through exercises to deepen understanding

FUTURE: Consider interactive visualizations or animations for complex operations like TCO.
