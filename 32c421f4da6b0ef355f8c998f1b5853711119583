Context and Details for Test Fixes

BACKGROUND:
CI/CD pipeline showed failure with expect test on negative numbers.
Added functional tests for step4.

CHANGES MADE:
1. test_step1.exp:
   - Fixed send command for negative numbers using -- flag
   - Prevents expect from interpreting -456 as a flag

2. test/test_step4_functions.rb:
   - Created functional test for step4 expressions
   - Tests if, fn*, do, and basic operations
   - Uses timeout to prevent hanging

3. Makefile:
   - Added test_step4_functions.rb to test-unit target

TESTING:
The functional test approach needs refinement but provides
a framework for testing REPL-based implementations.

PRECONDITIONS:
- step4 implementation complete
- expect installed for integration tests

POSTCONDITIONS:
- CI/CD should pass expect tests
- Framework for testing REPL steps established

DEVIATIONS:
Using shell-based testing for REPL interactions

FOLLOW-UP:
1. Implement step5_tco
2. Complete remaining steps
3. Create AST auditor as requested
