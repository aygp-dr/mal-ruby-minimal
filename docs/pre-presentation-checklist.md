- [x] Quick demo script in review document
- [x] Performance characteristics documented
- [x] Trade-offs clearly stated

## Final Checks
- [x] Repository is public on GitHub
- [x] CI/CD pipeline working
- [x] Badges in README are accurate
- [x] Can be cloned and run immediately
- [x] No sensitive information in code

## Demo Commands Ready
```bash
# Basic setup
git clone https://github.com/aygp-dr/mal-ruby-minimal
cd mal-ruby-minimal
ruby mal_minimal.rb

# Quick impressive demo
(def! factorial (fn* (n) (if (< n 2) 1 (* n (factorial (- n 1))))))
(factorial 10)

# Show TCO doesn't blow stack
(def! sum-to (fn* (n acc) (if (= n 0) acc (sum-to (- n 1) (+ n acc)))))
(sum-to 10000 0)

# Macro example
(defmacro! unless (fn* (pred a b) `(if ~pred ~b ~a)))
(unless false "yes" "no")
```

## Key Messages for Presentation
1. **Extreme minimalism teaches fundamentals**
2. **Constraints drive innovation**
3. **Everything can be built from pairs**
4. **Trade-offs are explicit and educational**
5. **Documentation is as important as code**

## Potential Questions & Answers

**Q: Why no arrays/hashes?**
A: To demonstrate that everything in CS can be built from simple pairs, and to validate the Ruby Essence research about minimal AST nodes.

**Q: What's the performance impact?**
A: 10-100x slower than optimized implementations, but that's not the point - it's about education and understanding.

**Q: Could this be productionized?**
A: With significant optimization work, yes, but it would lose its pedagogical value. Better to use existing production Lisps.

**Q: What did you learn?**
A: That constraints force clarity, minimalism reveals complexity, and good documentation multiplies the value of code.

**Q: Next steps?**
A: Could port to other languages, add visualization tools, or use as basis for teaching materials.
